# Database_to_track_Annual_handoff_process_at_BlackChip_Semiconductors

## Company Background:
Blackchip is an upcoming semiconductor start-up specialized in developing low-cost hardware solutions for clients that are involved in Non-Profit activities. A typical project at BlackChip semiconductor starts with client placing a order and goes through several stages like
sales, management, design, verification, layout planning, silicon manufacturing.

## Process and Actors:
Once the client places an order, the sales inventory gets updated and a program manager gathers requirements to communicate to the designated Design Team. There are frequent architecture review meetings that are held until architecture is finalized. Once the architecture is finalized then the sales team performs projected cost benefit analysis and parallely Design development begins. For each design cycle, the verification team works on finding bugs within the design. If any breaks are found, then design is handed off to the design team to fix the issues. Once sign-off is clean, the layout engineer places the entire design on layout (A 3D platform) to simulate the actual chip before manufacturing. Once the layout process is finished, A core review meeting is held to take care of any last-minute hiccups before proceeding to silicon manufacturing.Once silicon manufacturing completes, the sales team performs actual cost benefit analysis and the order is fulfilled to the customer.
● Client - Each client places orders based on their requirements. They can make multiple orders.
● Sales - They handle the inventory updates. They also work on Actual and Projected cost benefit analysis, profit or loss estimation during the entire project life cycle.
● Project manager (Management) - They receive the order and deliver the requirements to the appropriate design teams. They also conduct the review meetings across the teams.They are also part of signing-off of the project before delivering the order to silicon manufacturer
● Design & verification Team - They design the chips, involve in hardware development and after the designing, they conduct various verifications on those chips.
● Layout team - They perform chip planning on the designed and verified chips based.
● Silicon manufacture - Post Layouting, silicon manufacturer manufactures the chips based on the order count.

# Custom Report Generation

## Bonus Report Generation
### Business Requirement:
Time has come for the HR Manager of BlackChip semiconductors to roll-out the annual bonus for every employee. He has decided to set around 3% on overall profit generated by the projects worked by the employee as a bonus. 
### Description:
For every employee in every department, based on the number of orders he has worked on, we calculated the total profit generated across the orders. Further we computed the annual bonus of an employee by considering 3% of total profit generated by the projects worked by the employee as bonus.
### Functions used
GROUP BY, ORDER BY, UNION ALL, JOIN, SUBQUERIES, SUM, CONCAT, ROUND.
