# Database for efficient Annual Handoff Process at BlackChip Semiconductors

## Company Background:
Blackchip is an upcoming semiconductor start-up specialized in developing low-cost hardware solutions for clients that are involved in Non-Profit activities. A typical project at BlackChip semiconductor starts with client placing a order and goes through several stages like
sales, management, design, verification, layout planning, silicon manufacturing.

## Process and Actors:
Once the client places an order, the sales inventory gets updated and a program manager gathers requirements to communicate to the designated Design Team. There are frequent architecture review meetings that are held until architecture is finalized. Once the architecture is finalized then the sales team performs projected cost benefit analysis and parallely Design development begins. For each design cycle, the verification team works on finding bugs within the design. If any breaks are found, then design is handed off to the design team to fix the issues. Once sign-off is clean, the layout engineer places the entire design on layout (A 3D platform) to simulate the actual chip before manufacturing. Once the layout process is finished, A core review meeting is held to take care of any last-minute hiccups before proceeding to silicon manufacturing.Once silicon manufacturing completes, the sales team performs actual cost benefit analysis and the order is fulfilled to the customer.

‚óè Client - Each client places orders based on their requirements. They can make multiple orders.

‚óè Sales - They handle the inventory updates. They also work on Actual and Projected cost benefit analysis, profit or loss estimation during the entire project life cycle.

‚óè Project manager (Management) - They receive the order and deliver the requirements to the appropriate design teams. They also conduct the review meetings across the teams.They are also part of signing-off of the project before delivering the order to silicon manufacturer

‚óè Design & verification Team - They design the chips, involve in hardware development and after the designing, they conduct various verifications on those chips.

‚óè Layout team - They perform chip planning on the designed and verified chips based.

‚óè Silicon manufacture - Post Layouting, silicon manufacturer manufactures the chips based on the order count.

## Design Tracking Report
### Business Requirement:
Blackchip semiconductors company wants to track their hardware designs, specifications, design cycle time, bugs resolving time as well as layout specifications in order to optimize their time and scope.
### Description:

ü°∫	Based on the design start date and design end date, the design duration for each design has been determined. This will be utilized when the organization receives a new project and needs to pick which design team to assign it to finish it on time.

ü°∫	 We've also computed the duration for each bug to be resolved, using the bugs logged in date and bugs logged out date as inputs. This time frame will assist the organization in determining how long it takes to fix a bug. The company will be able to estimate the time it will take to remedy the problem and the root cause of the problem by comparing it to the bugs description.

ü°∫	 It also depends on the metal layer utilized for the chip and the voltage domain of the device in most circumstances. The company will get an idea about the faults that happened in a certain range by dividing the voltage domain into various ranges and comparing it to the bugs description.
